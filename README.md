# Characterization data for read latency relaxation

This repository mainly store the raw data of each characterization-related figures shown in our paper and the lifetime and latency statistic information. Please note that the actual raw characterization data for each SSD (up to 3TB) is too large to be fit into the github repository. 

## The sizes of read-latency data for each characterization SSDs.

| SSD Name | Size  | 
| ---------| ------| 
| SSD-A    | 156GB | 
| SSD-B    | 164GB | 
| SSD-C    | 165GB | 
| SSD-D    | 537GB | 
| SSD-E    | 446GB | 
| SSD-F    | 509GB | 
| SSD-G    | 424GB | 
| SSD-H    | 126GB | 
| SSD-I    | 406GB | 
| SSD-J    |  31GB | 

Note that we only provide some read latency time serieses for SSD-I since we characterized SSD-I for a long time and their read latencies get obvious increased.

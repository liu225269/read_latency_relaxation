# Directory information

This directory contains the latency serieses of a few thousand logical addresses of SSD-I. Note that the entire SSD-I logical address is too large to upload all of the characterization data to github. Hence, if you need the entire dataset, please contact me (cql5513@psu.edu), and I will share the download links (folders) to you.
